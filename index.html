                Listen, I spend ten hours a day elbow-deep in the dirt just to keep a hydrangea from committing suicide. If you aren't willing to occasionally put down the glowing rectangle and touch something that actually has a pulse—or at least a root system—then don't come crying to me when your soul starts smelling like a basement. Go outside. Touch the grass. If you’re lucky, it might even touch you back, though usually that's just the fire ants.
